TODOS:
1. Add the case where wifi disconnects from esp32.
[X]2. Read values every minute.
[X]3. HTTP request and queries for GT server
[]4. Individual stack for each task keeping running avg. (stack can hold any data type, it is implemented as singly linked list), implement the functions
[X]5. Find out how to create a task for each pin and how would the priorities will be between these tasks.
[]6. Find out how the deep sleep works. For power saving purposes.
[X]7. Find out how to send commands from the android application to the esp32. (Bluetooth, WIFI, ?) --> public MQTT server will be used. If not polling.
[X]8. Add ADC for sensors
[]9. Bluetooth SPP to configure the wifi.

Notes:
    There is going to be 3 or 4 writer tasks and one modifier task(or 2 depending on how to structure it). 
    This means that synchronization is only necessary between modifiers (if there is only one modifier there is no need for a synchronization mechnism).
    -- shared data structure will not be used--
    An array will be used by each task to store their last 5 readings.
