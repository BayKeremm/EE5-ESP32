< >TODOS:
[X]1. Add the case where wifi disconnects from esp32.
[X]2. Read values every minute.
[X]3. HTTP request and queries for GT server
[X]4. Individual stack for each task keeping running avg. 
[X]5. Find out how to create a task for each pin and how would the priorities will be between these tasks.
[NO]6. Find out how the deep sleep works. For power saving purposes.
[X]7. Find out how to send commands from the android application to the esp32. (Bluetooth, WIFI, ?) --> public MQTT server will be used. If not polling.
[X]8. Add ADC for sensors
[X]9. SmartConfig to conenct to the wifi without credentials hard coded 
[X]10. MQTT subcribe publish manager
[X]11. PWM
[NO]12. Add sntp protocol to sync time and be able to check it reqularly, parametrise a function for it which returns an int which has the same format with the api response.
[X]13. Parse the API response in http_on_data_event 
[X]14. Add TLS to the requests.
[X]15. Add json web token for the API calls.

// FINAL STEPS
[]*. Put all the components together and assure problem free operation.
[]*. Refactor the code, search for efficient ways.

PHP REST API
[]1. put time parameter on the server




Notes:
    -- shared data structure will not be used--
    An array will be used by each task to store their last 5 readings.
    Find out the MQTT broker cheese. -> done
    How to save power ?
    Adding security. JWT(json web token) --> going to be hard coded ? --> yes

    ???
    manual mode and automatic mdoe discussion. DONE
